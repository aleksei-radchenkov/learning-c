# 190. Reverse Bits

**Difficulty:** Easy  

---

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

---

## Note

- In some languages (such as Java), there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type.
- This should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents signed integers using 2's complement notation. For example:
  - In **Example 2**, the input represents the signed integer `-3`, and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

## Example 1

**Input:**  
`n = 43261596`  
**Output:**  
`964176192`

**Explanation:**

| Integer     | Binary                                |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 43261596    | `00000010100101000001111010011100`     |
| 964176192   | `00111001011110000010100101000000`     |

---

## Example 2

**Input:**  
`n = 2147483644`  
**Output:**  
`1073741822`

**Explanation:**

| Integer     | Binary                                |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 2147483644  | `01111111111111111111111111111100`     |
| 1073741822  | `00111111111111111111111111111110`     |

---

## Constraints

- `0 <= n <= 2^31 - 2`
- `n` is even.

---

## Follow-up

If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
