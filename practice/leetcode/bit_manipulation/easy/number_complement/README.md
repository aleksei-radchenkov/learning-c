# 476. Number Complement

**[Solution](./solution.c) - [Notes](./notes.md)**

## Description
The complement of an integer is obtained by flipping all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

Given an integer `num`, return its complement.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** `num = 5`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 5 is 101, and its complement is 010 which is 2 in decimal.

### Example 2
**Input:** `num = 1`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:** The binary representation of 1 is 1, and its complement is 0.

## Constraints
- `1 <= num < 2³¹`

## Note
This question is the same as 1009: Complement of Base 10 Integer.
