# 762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation

**[Solution](./solution.c) - [Notes](./notes.md)**

## Description
Given two integers `left` and `right`, return the count of numbers in the inclusive range `[left, right]` having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

A set bit is a `1` in the binary representation of a number.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** `left = 6, right = 10`  
**Output:** `4`

### Example 2
**Input:** `left = 10, right = 15`  
**Output:** `5`

## Constraints
- `1 <= left <= right <= 10⁶`
- `0 <= right - left <= 10⁴`
