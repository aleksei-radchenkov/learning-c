# 461. Hamming Distance

**[Solution](./solution.c) - [Notes](./notes.md)**

## Description
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, return the Hamming distance between them.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** `x = 1`, `y = 4`  
**Output:** `2`

### Example 2
**Input:** `x = 3`, `y = 1`  
**Output:** `1`

## Constraints
- `0 <= x, y <= 2³¹ - 1`

## Note
This question is the same as 2220: Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number.
