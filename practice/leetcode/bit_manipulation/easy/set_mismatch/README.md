# 645. Set Mismatch

## Description
You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contained all numbers from `1` to `n`. Due to an error, one number was duplicated and another went missing.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the data after the error, find the duplicated number and the missing number, and return them as an array.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** `nums = [1,2,2,4]`  
**Output:** `[2,3]`

### Example 2
**Input:** `nums = [1,1]`  
**Output:** `[1,2]`

## Constraints
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10⁴`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁴`
